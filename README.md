# TODO, somewhat prioritized

- WiFi & Password in Memory!

  - On startup check if wifi/pass present, if yes do the default thing
    - Otherwise act as a Access Point and serve the same page

- Neater looking port config. Smoller color squares, no text. There might be moar options in the future.
- Proper error habndling in API, so ESP does not choke it self
- Moar effects!
- Use compression mate: https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap11%20-%20SPIFFS.html
- Design pass?

# To update SPIFFS

- PlatformIO Menu
- Platform
- Build Filesystem Image
- Upload Filesystem Image
- Profit

# Bugz
